\title{Generate a synthetic APSIM soil profile from the ISRIC soil database}
\usage{
get_isric_soil_profile(
  lonlat,
  statistic = c("mean", "Q0.5"),
  soil.profile,
  find.location.name = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lonlat}{Longitude and latitude vector (e.g. c(-93, 42)).}

\item{statistic}{default is the mean}

\item{soil.profile}{a soil profile to fill in in case the default one is not appropriate}

\item{find.location.name}{default is TRUE. Use either maps package or photon API to find Country/State.
If you are running this function many times it might be better to set this to FALSE.}

TODO: need to look into how this is done in APSIM NG
https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX/pull/3994/files \cr

NOTE: Eric Zurcher provided help by sending me an R file originally written by
Andrew Moore. It provides a bit of context for how some of the decisions
were made for constructing the synthetic soil profiles in APSIM. (email from june 3 2021).

Variable which are directly retrieved and a simple unit conversion is performed: \cr
* Bulk density - bdod \cr
* Carbon - soc \cr
* Clay - clay \cr
* Sand - sand \cr
* PH - phh2o \cr
* Nitrogen - nitrogen \cr
Variables which are estimated using pedotransfer functions: \cr
LL15, DUL, SAT, KS, AirDry \cr
TO-DO: \cr
What do I do with nitrogen? \cr
Can I use CEC? \cr
How can I have a guess at FBiom and Finert? \cr
FBiom does not depend on any soil property at the moment, should it? \cr
